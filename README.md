# Barber_Shop_Optimisation
This project was done as a part of the course ME308 - Industrial Engineering and Operations Research. We would like to thank Professor Avinash Bharadwaj and Professor Makarand Kulkarni for their continued guidance throughout the project. Our project considers the problem of scheduling in a barber shop with two objectives - (1) Optimizing the net daily profit (2) Optimizing the amount of discount that should be offered for delay in services and the amount of membership fee that should be charged from the premium customers. We model our problem as an identical parallel machine scheduling problem. For the first objective, we make use of 3 meta-heuristics: Simulated Annealing and Genetic Algorithm and Artifical Bee Colony Algorithm(ABC). We found that the genetic algorithm not only produces better results than simulated annealing and ABC but is also faster than simulated annealing. We modify the problem statement for the second objective to make it more realistic. We found that there is an optimal middle ground between discount and membership fees contrary to the common misconception that a high value of membership fees and a low value of discount would yield higher profits. Team includes Nikhil Saini(me), Prabhash kumar, Vinayak and Vivek kumar.
